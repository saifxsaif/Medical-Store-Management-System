This code is designed for a medical store named RAAS. It is a go-to solution for
the pharmacy for both the administrator server and the customer portal.

### Details of each feature:
The code provides the pharmacy with both the solution for the administrator as well as
the customer and can either be switched depending upon the individual’s
requirement.

username “saifullah” and password “1234”. The list of multi-dialogue tasks the
admin could perform including viewing the customer details or checking up on the
appointments or getting the information or even altering the information of the
medicines existing in the store.

Whereas, if the person enters as a customer through the user interface, he could
get the options to purchase the medicines depending upon his demand and
quantity or he could set an appointment which would be stored in the admin
server or he could view an existing loyalty card or set up a new one.

### Real-life application:
It is a code which can be used in a medical pharmacy with access to both the
server programs displaying the front-end portal that the customer uses and manages and 
keeps the record at the back end of existing administrative
server.
